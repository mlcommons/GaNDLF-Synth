## Introduction

To train generative DL models, the usual workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Prepare the data
2. Split data into training, validation, and testing
3. Customize the training parameters
4. Train the model
5. Perform inference

GaNDLF-Synth supports all of these steps, but some are optional depending on the nature of the generation task. For example, sometimes it's preferred to avoid splitting the data, and instead use the whole dataset for training. GaNDLF-Synth provides the necessary tools to perform these tasks, using both custom features and the ones provided by GaNDLF. We describe all the functionalities in the following sections. For more details on the functionalities specific to GaNDLF, refer to the [GaNDLF documentation](https://docs.mlcommons.org/GaNDLF).

## Installation

Please follow the [installation instructions](./setup.md#installation) to install GaNDLF-Synth.

## Preparing the Data
## Constructing the Data CSV

GaNDLF-Synth can leverage multiple channels/modalities for training using a multi-class segmentation file. The expected format is shown in example CSVs in [samples directory](https://github.com/mlcommons/GaNDLF-Synth/blob/main/samples) for both labeled and unlabeled data. The CSV file needs to be structured with the following header format (which shows a CSV with `N` subjects, each having `X` channels/modalities that need to be processed):

#### Unlabeled Data
```csv
Channel_0,Channel_1,...,Channel_X
$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/1/1.nii.gz,$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/1/2.nii.gz,...,
$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/2/1.nii.gz,$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/2/2.nii.gz,...,
$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/3/1.nii.gz,$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/3/2.nii.gz,...,
...
```

#### Labeled Data
```csv
Channel_0,Channel_1,Label,LabelMapping
$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-1/1/t2w.nii.gz,$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-1/1/t1.nii.gz,0,$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-1
$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-1/2/t2w.nii.gz,$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-1/2/t1.nii.gz,0,$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-1
$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-1/3/t2w.nii.gz,$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-1/3/t1.nii.gz,0,$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-1
$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-2/1/t2w.nii.gz,$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-2/1/t1.nii.gz,1,$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-2
$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-2/2/t2w.nii.gz,$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-2/2/t1.nii.gz,1,$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-2
$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-2/3/t2w.nii.gz,$ROOT-PATH-TO-DATA-FOLDER/$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-2/3/t1.nii.gz,1,$CLASS-FOLDER-NAME-2

...
```

**Notes:**

- For labeled data, the CSV needs to have additonal columns to include the labels corresponding to a given set of channels. It also needs a column for the label mapping, showing the class name assigned to the label value.

### Using the `gandlf-synth construct-csv` command

To make the process of creating the CSV easier, we have provided a `gandlf-synth construct-csv` command. The data has to be arranged in different formats, depending on the labeling paradigm. Modality names are used as examples.

#### Unlabeled Data

```bash
$DATA_DIRECTORY
│
└───Patient_001 
│   │ Patient_001_brain_t1.nii.gz
│   │ Patient_001_brain_t1ce.nii.gz
│   │ Patient_001_brain_t2.nii.gz
│   │ Patient_001_brain_flair.nii.gz
│   
│
└───Patient_002 
│   │ Patient_002_brain_t1.nii.gz
│   │ Patient_002_brain_t1ce.nii.gz
│   │ Patient_002_brain_t2.nii.gz
│   │ Patient_002_brain_flair.nii.gz
│   
...
|
└───JaneDoe # Patient name can be different
│   │ randomFileName_0_t1.nii.gz 
│   │ randomFileName_1_t1ce.nii.gz
│   │ randomFileName_2_t2.nii.gz
│   │ randomFileName_3_flair.nii.gz
│   │ randomFileName_seg.nii.gz 
│
...
```

#### Custom Class Labeled Data

```bash
$DATA_DIRECTORY
│
└───Class_1 # the class name can be different
│   │
│   └───Patient_001
│   │   │ Patient_001_brain_t1.nii.gz
│   │   │ Patient_001_brain_t1ce.nii.gz
│   │   │ Patient_001_brain_t2.nii.gz
│   │   │ Patient_001_brain_flair.nii.gz
│   │
│   └───Patient_002
│       │ Patient_002_brain_t1.nii.gz
│       │ Patient_002_brain_t1ce.nii.gz
│       │ Patient_002_brain_t2.nii.gz

│
└───Class_2
│   │
│   └───Patient_003
│   │   │ Patient_003_brain_t1.nii.gz
│   │   │ Patient_003_brain_t1ce.nii.gz
│   │   │ Patient_003_brain_t2.nii.gz
│   │   │ Patient_003_brain_flair.nii.gz
│   │
...

└───Class_N
    │
    └───Patient_M
        │ Patient_M_brain_t1.nii.gz
        │ Patient_M_brain_t1ce.nii.gz
        │ Patient_M_brain_t2.nii.gz
        │ Patient_M_brain_flair.nii.gz
```


#### Per Patient Labeled Data

The folder structure is the same as that of unlabeled data. In the csv, the labels are assigned per patient. 

The following command shows how the script works:

```bash
# continue from previous shell
(venv_gandlf) $> gandlf-synth construct-csv \
  # -h, --help         Show help message and exit
  -i $DATA_DIRECTORY # this is the main data directory 
  -ch _t1.nii.gz,_t1ce.nii.gz,_t2.nii.gz,_flair.nii.gz \ # an example image identifier for structural brain MR sequences for BraTS, and can be changed based on your data. In the simplest case of a single modality, a ".nii.gz" will suffice
  -l 'unlabeled' \ # labeling paradigm, can be 'unlabeled', 'patient', or 'custom'
  -o ./experiment_0/train_data.csv # output CSV to be used for training
```

## Customize the Training

Adapting GaNDLF to your needs boils down to modifying a YAML-based configuration file which controls the parameters of training and inference. Below is a list of available samples for users to start as their baseline for further customization:

- [DDPM (unlabeled paradigm)](https://github.com/mlcommons/GaNDLF-Synth/blob/main/samples/example_config_ddpm_unlabeled.yaml)
- [VQVAE (unlabeled paradigm)](https://github.com/mlcommons/GaNDLF-Synth/blob/main/samples/example_config_vqvae_unlabeled.yaml)

<!-- To find **all the parameters** a GaNDLF config may modify, consult the following file: 
- [All available options](https://github.com/mlcommons/GaNDLF-Synth/blob/main/samples/config_all_options.yaml) -->

**Notes**: 

- More details on the configuration options are available in the [customization page](customize.md).
- Ensure that the configuration has valid syntax by checking the file using any YAML validator such as [yamlchecker.com](https://yamlchecker.com/) or [yamlvalidator.com](https://yamlvalidator.com/) **before** trying to train.



## Running GaNDLF-Synth (Training/Inference)

You can use the following code snippet to run GaNDLF:

```bash
# continue from previous shell
(venv_gandlf) $> gandlf-synth run \
  # -h, --help         Show help message and exit
  # -v, --version      Show program's version number and exit.
  -c ./experiment_0/model.yaml \ # model configuration - needs to be a valid YAML (check syntax using https://yamlchecker.com/)
  -dt ./experiment_0/train.csv \ # main data CSV used for training (or inference if performing image-to-image reconstruction)
  -m-dir ./experiment_0/model_dir/ \ # model directory where the output of the training will be stored, created if not present
  -t \ # enable training (if not enabled, inference is performed)
  # -v-csv ./experiment_0/val.csv \ # [optional] validation data CSV (if the model performs validation step)
  # -t-csv ./experiment_0/test.csv \ # [optional] testing data CSV (if the model performs testing step)
  # -vr 0.1 \ # [optional] ratio of validation data to extract from the training data CSV. If -v-csv flag is set, this is ignored
  # -tr 0.1 \ # [optional] ratio of testing data to extract from the training data CSV. If -t-csv flag is set, this is ignored
  # -i-dir ./experiment_0/inference_dir/ \ # [optional] inference directory where the output of the inference will be stored, created if not present. Used only if inference is enabled
  # -ckpt-path ./experiment_0/model_dir/checkpoint.ckpt \ # [optional] path to the checkpoint file to resume training from or to use for inference. If not provided, the latest (or best) checkpoint is used when resuming training or performing inference
  # -rt , --reset # [optional] completely resets the previous run by deleting `model-dir`
  # -rm , --resume # [optional] resume previous training by only keeping model dict in `model-dir`
```
## Parallelize the Training and Inference

### Using single or multiple GPUs
GaNDLF-Synth supports using single or multiple GPUs out of the box. By default, if the GPU is available (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is set), training and inference will use it. If multiple GPUs are available, GaNDLF-Synth will use all of them by DDP strategy (described below).

### Using Distributed Strategies
We currently support [DDP](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html) and [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/getting-started/). 
To use ddp, just configure the number of nodes and type strategy name "ddp" under "compute" field in the config.

```yaml
compute:
  num_devices: 2         # if not set, all GPUs available will 
  num_nodes: 2           # if not set, one node training is assumed
  strategy: "ddp"
  strategy_config: {}    # additional strategy specific kwargs, see https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api/lightning.pytorch.strategies.DDPStrategy.html#lightning.pytorch.strategies.DDPStrategy

```
For deepspeed, we leverage the original `deepspeed` library config to set the distributed parameters. To use `deepspeed`, configure the `compute` field as follows:

```yaml
compute:
  num_devices: 2         # if not set, all GPUs available will 
  num_nodes: 2           # if not set, one node training is assumed
  strategy: "deepspeed"
  strategy_config: 
    config: "path-to-deepspeed-config.json"    # path to the deepspeed config file
```
Details of this config file can be found in the deepspeed documentation here: https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/
Please read further details in the Lightning guide: https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/advanced/model_parallel/deepspeed.html#custom-deepspeed-config.
Note that you will probably need to override the optimizer choice with one of optimized ones available in `deepspeed`. This optimizer can be set in the `.json` config of the strategy (scheduler can be specified here too) and will take precedence over the one specified in the base `yaml` config file.

### Mixed precision training:
We currently support mixed precision training based on [lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/mixed_precision.html). To use mixed precision, please set the "precision" field in the "compute" field. All available precision options can be found under the link above. 

```yaml
compute:
  precision: "16"        
```
Some models (like VQVAE) may not support mixed precision training, so please check the model documentation before enabling it.

## Expected Output(s)

### Training

Once your model is trained, you should see the following outputin the model directory:

```bash
# continue from previous shell
(venv_gandlf) $> ls ./experiment_0/model_dir/
checkpoints/ # directory containing all the checkpoints
training_logs/ # directory containing all the training logs
eval_images/ # optionally created - if model was configured to periodically save evaluation images after N epochs (only for 2D runs)
parameters.pkl # the used configuration file
training_manager.log # global log file of the training manager
```
If you performed inference, the inference directory will contain the following:

```bash
# continue from previous shell
(venv_gandlf) $> ls ./experiment_0/inference_dir/
inference_output/ # directory containing all the inference output (synthesized images)
ingerence_logs/ # directory containing all the inference logs from the trainer
inference_manager.log # global log file of the inference manager
```
